# Insertion sort is sorting technique that works by finding the correct position of the element in the array and then inserting it into its correct position.

# Binary search is searching technique that works by finding the middle of the array for finding the element.

# As the complexity of binary search is of logarithmic order, the searching algorithmâ€™s time complexity will also decrease to of logarithmic order.

# The Boyer-Moore Algorithm
# Three ideas
# Right-to left scan of the pattern at each possible alignment
# Precompute R(x) to compute shifts when mismatches occur
# Precompute L'(i) and l'(i) using suffix matches for further shifts
# Definition: R(x) is the position of the rightmost occurrence of x in P (or zero)
#
# Example: P = actca, so R(a) = 5, R(c) = 4, R(g) = 0, R(t) = 3
#
# T = actgactaactca
# P = actca
# Bad character shift rule: If the first mismatch is found at position i (when scanning the pattern right to left) and T(k) is the text character that mismatches P(i), then shift the pattern right by max(1, i - R(T(k))
#
# In the above example, i = k = 4 and T(k) = g, so the shift is 4 - R(g) = 4
#
# Extended bad character shift rule: shift so that the next occurrence of T(k) in P (scanning left) is matched to T(k)
